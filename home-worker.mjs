/**
 * Entry for the production Worker golden-wings-robyn-home (wrangler.home.jsonc).
 * It answers the 4 Storyblok pages, their /_nuxt build files, /api/storyblok/* and the fonts the
 * live site lacks (home-routing.mjs). With HOME_PASSTHROUGH="1" every other request goes on,
 * unchanged, via fetch(request) to the live Worker golden-wings-robyn (the custom domain on the
 * same hostname; a route Worker's fetch() reaches the custom domain Worker behind it).
 * Switch off: HOME_PASSTHROUGH anything but "1" serves everything from Nuxt.
